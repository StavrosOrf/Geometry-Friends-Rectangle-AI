## 1 Introduction

Geometry Friends is a two player cooperative puzzle computer game developed
at GAIPS INESC-ID. The competition consists of creating artificial players for
the cooperative platform puzzle game Geometry Friends. There are two large
sections of the competition. The first consists of the ”The Cooperation Track”
which focuses on developing two AI players, capable of cooperating with each
other in order to solve levels designed for player cooperation. The other one is
”The Single AI Track” which consists of two sub-tracks: the Circle Track and the
Rectangle Track. Each sub-track will focus exclusively on the development of
one of the two characters of the game. These tracks are targeted at participants
that want to tackle the problems of the domain (physics-based platform puzzle),
without the complexity of cooperation. Typically, the Rectangle Track presents
more challenges in puzzle solving and the Circle Track presents more challenges
in the actuation in the environment. In this specific project i focused on solving
the single rectangle track using A* algorithm and many other physics simulation
functions.
